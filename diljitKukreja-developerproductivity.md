For example they don't have to be in a meeting they don't need to contribute . 

## Dora Matrics 
- lead times. - I have the requirement I have to go to production .
- MTTR metrics - Maintaining and deploying software in production . 
- Deploy frequency - How fast you are deploying in prodiction .  (HOw frequently are we going to production) 
- Change failure rate - How well we failing in the production .
- What is the phase your product in . 
- GenAi code generation - (Some are claiming 25% , a lot of people are claiming different numbers) 
## Space Metrics

## How to impove Dora metrics
- lead times. - I have the requirement I have to go to production .
- MTTR metrics - Maintaining of deploying software in production . (R is the restore - So recover the software comes first)  
- Deploy frequency - How fast you are deploying in prodiction .  (HOw frequently are we going to production)
   - How to improve .
   - What tools should we should use.
   - GENAI Capbilities -
   -     Chatbot - Generate Architecture diagram
   -     Review architecture diagram .
   -     Code generation tool .
   -     A combination of those deal with faster deployment. 
   -     PR reviews
   -         - Some of these are opinion . 
   - How are the PR cycle times .         
- Change failure rate - How well we failing in the production .
- What is the phase your product in .
- Measure what matters and keep deploying . Celebrate around it . Keep in a counter violation to prevent gamification of the system . (Sonar Metrics )
- How to measure under performance.
-     - How do we draw a line between what's on the ground
